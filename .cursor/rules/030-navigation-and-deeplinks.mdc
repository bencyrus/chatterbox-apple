# Navigation

- Use `NavigationStack` with type-safe destinations (route enums or typed paths).
- Centralize route definitions in the composition root; views trigger navigation via ViewModel intents.

# Deep Links

- Implement `onOpenURL` and a `DeepLinkParser` to map URLs to typed routes.
- Validate and sanitize deep link inputs; ignore malformed or unsafe routes.

# Back Behavior

- Preserve user expectations for back navigation; do not pop on background operations.
