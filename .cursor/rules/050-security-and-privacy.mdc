# Data Protection

- Store tokens/keys in Keychain with appropriate accessibility.
- Use CryptoKit for cryptographic operations; do not implement custom crypto.

# Permissions

- Request microphone permission just-in-time with clear rationale.
- Include required Info.plist usage descriptions.

# PII & Logging

- No PII or secrets in logs. Use `os.Logger` with privacy redaction.

# Threat Awareness

- For features handling sensitive data, include a threat consideration step during implementation (rules only, no docs now).
