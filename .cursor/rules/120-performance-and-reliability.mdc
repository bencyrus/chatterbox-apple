# Performance

- Minimize SwiftUI recomputation via state scoping and memoization where appropriate.
- Use lazy containers for large lists; paginate network calls.

# Reliability

- Retry transient network failures with backoff where safe.
- Persist minimal state needed for recovery; avoid data corruption.
