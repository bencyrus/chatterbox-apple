# Purpose

Set non-negotiable guardrails: clean system design, security-first, and rigorous traceability.

# Core Directives

- Follow Apple's API Design Guidelines and Swift conventions.
- Prefer clarity and correctness over cleverness.
- Treat the app as production-grade from day one.

# Documentation Policy (rules only)

- After any code/config/test/resource change, Cursor must update project documentation and change logs. Do NOT generate docs now; this file only defines the rule.

# Prohibited

- Force unwraps (`!`) and `try!`.
- Global mutable state.
- Printing secrets or PII.
- Dead/commented-out code.

# Required

- Input validation and explicit error handling.
- Accessibility and localization for user-facing UI.
- Tests for core business logic and critical flows.

# Review Checklist

- Architecture consistent with MVVM + Use Cases + Repository?
- Security/privacy intact? No sensitive logs?
- Documentation policy considered for future updates?
- Tests added/updated as needed?
